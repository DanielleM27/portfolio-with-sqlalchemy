Treehouse Python Techdegree Unit 5 Project - Portfolio with SQLAlchemy

Project Overview

An interface for a portfolio web application that I have made myself. The main (index) page lists my Treehouse Techdegree projects including the project title and short descriptions. Each project links to a detail page that displays the title, date, and description.

The application lets a user add or edit project information. When adding or editing a project, the application prompts the user for title, date, skills, description, and a link to a repo. The results for these entries are stored in a database and displayed on the homepage. The HTML/CSS for this site has been supplied by Team Treehouse. 

How to run locally:
1. Download the project files from my github or clone the repo.
2. Create a virtual environment within the project file.
3. Install packages as stated in the requirements.txt file.
4. Run app.py from the terminal.
5. Visit http://127.0.0.1:8000 in your browser and navigate the website. 
Enjoy!
